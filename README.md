## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### **TensorFlow.js** - Real-Time AI Model Deployment
- **TensorFlow.js** powers the machine learning models deployed directly in the browser. This allows **ChestVision AI** to perform **real-time predictions** and inference, without needing to send sensitive medical data to external servers. The entire process happens on the user's device, ensuring **data privacy** and **speed**.
- The **Multi-Disease Detection Model** was trained by **Bach** using a **complex residual network**, enabling the model to accurately predict **14 different chest-related conditions** from X-ray images. The training process took **3.68 hours** using the **ChestX-ray14 Dataset**, with a total of **78,468 images** for training, **11,218 images** for validation, and **22,432 images** for testing.

### **Particles.js** - Interactive Background Animations
- To elevate the user experience, **Particles.js** adds stunning, interactive particle animations in the background. This dynamic and engaging effect helps guide the user‚Äôs focus toward the central content while creating a more immersive environment for image analysis.
- The interactive design responds to user actions such as scrolling and mouse movements, adding an element of fun and delight to the otherwise clinical environment of a medical app.

### **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** - Smooth Scroll Animations
- The **AOS library** is utilized to add smooth and captivating scroll-based animations. These animations trigger as the user scrolls down the page, adding a layer of engagement while also making the interface feel more fluid.
- Whether it's fading in the content, sliding in elements from the side, or other animations, **AOS** ensures the experience remains fresh and visually appealing as users explore the platform.

### **Modern CSS Techniques** - Responsive and Elegant Design
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** were used extensively in the layout to ensure a **responsive**, **flexible**, and **user-friendly interface**. These powerful layout systems ensure that the platform adapts perfectly to any screen size, whether on a mobile, tablet, or desktop.
- **Glassmorphism** was incorporated to create a sleek, **frosted-glass** effect, adding modern aesthetics and enhancing visual clarity. This effect uses translucent backgrounds with subtle blur effects to keep the focus on the content while giving the platform a futuristic look.
  
### Model-Specific Details:

#### **Multi-Disease Detection Model** (14 conditions)
- **Training Time**: 3.68 hours
